    question: "Is Deal Diner safe to use?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Deal Diner is 100% safe to use. We rely on Uber Eats‚Äô native group ordering functionality and do not require you to provide any account credentials or personal logins. All data shared is voluntary, and we never access your Uber account. Your only interaction is providing the group order link you created yourself.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this method legal?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The process is fully legal. We are simply coordinating Uber Eats group orders using features intended for that purpose. You are not exploiting any backend loopholes or performing unauthorized actions. Just make sure your usage complies with Uber's Terms of Service, for example, don‚Äôt spam stores, and avoid fake address entries.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to pay before I get food?",
    answer:
      "Yes, payment is required upfront to secure your order and to allow chefs to process your cart using the available promotions. Once your order is placed, you‚Äôll receive a real-time Uber Eats tracking link and delivery PIN if applicable.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does delivery take?",
    answer:
      "This depends on restaurant prep time, your delivery distance, and Uber driver availability in your area. Most orders are placed within 5‚Äì15 minutes of ticket creation, and delivery typically arrives within 30‚Äì60 minutes, depending on demand and time of day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a refund if something goes wrong?",
    answer:
      "Refunds are generally not provided unless there is clear proof of an issue that was caused on our end. If your food does not arrive, arrives incorrect, or has another issue, please report it immediately. We will investigate and assist where possible, but due to the nature of group ordering and discounts, all sales are typically final.",
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods are accepted?",
    answer:
      "We accept Cash App, Venmo, PayPal (Friends & Family), and other flexible payment platforms. Check with the chef handling your order for availability or preferred options. Always confirm payment before expecting an order confirmation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I create a group order link?",
    answer:
      "Log in to Uber Eats, add your desired items to your cart, then click the three dots on the browser or the üë§ icon on the mobile app. From there, choose 'Invite People' and copy the group order link. Paste this link into your Deal Diner ticket to initiate the order.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between 20 OFF 20 and 25 OFF 25?",
    answer:
      "Both are limited-time Uber Eats promotions. '20 OFF 20' applies when your subtotal is at least $20, and is ideal for lighter meals or solo orders. '25 OFF 25' applies at $25+, and is best used for larger meals or groups. We‚Äôll help you choose the best promo based on your subtotal automatically.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get banned from Uber Eats?",
    answer:
      "We never log in to your account or use credentials. You are using your Uber Eats account normally, just via a group link. As long as you do not abuse promotions or violate Uber‚Äôs policies directly, there is no reason your account would be at risk.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit to how often I can order?",
    answer:
      "There‚Äôs no official limit, but to avoid potential abuse flags, we recommend not placing more than a few discounted orders per day. Chefs may limit access or impose cooldowns if abuse is detected.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this affiliated with Uber Eats?",
    answer:
      "No. Deal Diner is an independent group-buying coordination service built around Uber Eats‚Äô public group ordering functionality. We are not affiliated with or endorsed by Uber Technologies Inc.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use someone else's group link?",
    answer:
      "Yes, as long as the group order link is valid and the host (chef) is actively managing it. However, we strongly recommend opening your own ticket to keep your order organized and reduce confusion.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I ask more questions or get support?",
    answer:
      "Join our Discord server and head to ‚Å†üí¨‚îÇgeneral-chat for quick questions, or open a ‚Å†üé´‚îÇorders ticket to get personalized assistance from staff. We're here to help!",
  },
  {
    question: "How are the chefs trusted?",
    answer:
      "Chefs are manually vetted by our admin team. Many have completed hundreds of orders with high customer satisfaction. You can view vouches and feedback in our #vouches channel to verify their reputation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this outside the U.S.?",
    answer:
      "No. At this time, Deal Diner only supports Uber Eats group orders within the United States. Promo eligibility and store availability may vary by region.",
  },
